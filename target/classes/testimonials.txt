	'<p>For years I had an enlarged thyroid with a fluid filled cyst. Although my thyroid functioned normally the enlargement sometimes made it difficult to swallow and constantly pressed on my windpipe. An endocrinologist put me on Synthroid to reduce the swelling but it had very little effect, plus I knew it depleted calcium. After my thyroid was aspirated, the size only went down about 30%. At that point the doctor recommended that I have it surgically altered, either reduced in size or completely removed. </p><h5>Then I found Dr. Allyn. I especially liked her Naturopathic approach of determining the cause and not just treating the symptom.</h5><p>She suspected I had an iodine deficiency, and the tests she performed proved she was right. She put me on an iodine supplement and the results have been very positive. My throat looks and feels &apos;normal&apos; again. Thanks, Dr. Allyn.</p>'

One day I called Dr. Allyn about another condition that had arisen. She answered my question about the newest predicament, but then she called me a few days later. Dr. Allyn had studied my huge file and saw that there was a &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; of sorts. She suggested that I be tested for Lyme disease. She had pieced the puzzle together correctly.

       '<p>I am a 62 year-old male. For a period of almost 10 years, I have struggled with symptoms that got progressively worse and having Doctors repeatedly tell me they could find nothing wrong. One stated that I should be “thankful” for the shape I was in at my age. The only issues that seemed to consistently resurface in lab work was a deficiency in Vitamin D levels, which the Doctors addressed with advice to take an over-the-counter Vitamin D supplement, and some minor elevation in cholesterol levels (deemed typical for someone my age). However, taking Vitamin D supplements did not help with the deficiency.</p><p>I also struggled with weight issues, unable to get my weigh down into the 180 lb range from over 240 lbs. While I was already avoiding all the sugar, sugar substitutes and other bad things such as fried foods (those “evil” dietary no-no’s), this did not seem to help much. I tried two different &quot;Medi...&quot; programs in the area at great expense and loss of my personal time. While I realized small, short-term improvements in weight loss, 10-15 lbs. usually, I would reach plateaus below which nothing seemed to work. The weight would return as soon as I would leave the program, and the other symptoms (which I assumed were caused by the excessive weight) would never improve. Brain fog, digestive distress, weakness and feeling tired, loss of mental acuity, hair thinning, and skin aging problems were all slowly getting worse as the years passed. I felt like I was slowly being poisoned, but none of the Doctors I visited were of any help. Due to my age, 58 at the time, I did have a colonoscopy done which came back negative. The gastroenterologist had no explanation for the digestive issues I was having, despite my complaints and clear evidence to the contrary. I was getting very discouraged, because I knew something was very wrong. </p><p>Out of frustration, in December 2015 I began searching for medical studies that addressed the same symptoms I was realizing, and one thing kept surfacing again and again… problems with digestion related to gluten and its effects on body chemistry in general. As I researched further, the subject of “leaky gut syndrome” (intestinal permeability) seemed to also be associated with many of the symptoms from which I was suffering… again with its roots in gluten consumption. So, I began searching for a Doctor with expertise in these things in the greater Phoenix area and visited Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler. While she patiently and compassionately listened I shared my story with her, and we began a journey that has resulted in my feeling 20 years younger. </p><p>For the first 4-6 weeks, only minor change was noted. Then, almost suddenly, my weight started melting off at an amazing rate and my other symptoms began to improve. After about 6 months, I am now down almost 60 lbs to about 182 lbs (the same weight I was when I was in the Army 30 years ago!) without any change in exercise habits, without B-12 injections or other physical activity. My energy levels are much improved, and my mind is as sharp now as when I was in college (I am a computer scientist by trade). My digestion is back to normal, my lost hair is growing back, my skin looks much younger and I feel like a different person… all without taking any expensive (and potentially risky) prescription medications! Dr. Allyn also identified a genetic issue I have that addressed the Vitamin D deficiency, in that my body was unable to properly process Vitamin D (which is critical to good health) in the form commonly available as a over-the-counter supplement… something no other Doctor even considered checking over the years.</p><p>In short, I consider Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler a &quot;God-send&quot;. I cannot speak highly enough of both her genuine concern for me as a patient, and her technical competency. I no longer feel like my health is on a &quot;down-hill slide&quot; and I am looking forward to many more years of active and productive life with my wonderful wife. </p><p>I am now convinced that the foods we Americans commonly are &quot;sold&quot; in the stores and restaurants are a root cause of many American health issues. I am also convinced that Dr. Allyn is an exceptional healer, and worthy of my highest endorsement.</p>'

Past experience prompted Dr. Krieger-Fiedler to investigate whether or not gluten sensitivity may be the reason for the hyperactive immune system. Further testing confirmed her suspicions. I began a protocol of thyroid medication and a gluten free diet. All my symptoms soon started to resolve. After 8 months I was able to shed 30 pounds without starving myself.

I had to have an ultrasound of my thyroid before I started taking the iodine supplement. That revealed some spots on my thyroid. Dr. Allyn said not to worry. The iodine should take care of that. We continue to monitor my thyroid with ultrasounds.</P><P>I then started the program that she had laid out for me. We retested in a few weeks and found some new organism which she treated. I continued on the program for about 8 or 9 months and then we found that the pathogens were gone but that I still had no lactobacillus. I will continue to take a custom probiotic for that for quite a while.</P><P>We also tested my thyroid function with blood work which revealed that I had Hashimoto’s disease. I started taking thyroid medication (Nature-Throid) for the Hashimoto’s disease.</P><P>I have now lost 13 pounds with the program Dr. Allyn prescribed for me and I have so much more energy since starting the Nature-Throid. I feel so much better and had no idea I had so many things going on in my body.</P><P>I had other issues during that year, like a cat bite that became infected. Dr. Allyn called me every day to see how I was doing. She also did research to see what other things I could do to help with the infection and healing other than the antibiotics I had to take. She has always been there when I needed her. I don’t know how I got along this long without her.</P><P>I continue to see Dr. Allyn and we plan to continue to see what other issues I may not know about, like possible food allergies and whatever we decide I need to check out based on any symptoms I may have.</P><P>Dr. Allyn thanks for always being there and for being my friend.</P>'

       '<p>Dr. Allyn has been an extremely knowledgeable and helpful guide on my path to wellness. I live overseas and am only in the Phoenix area for a few weeks out of the year, but she was willing to work with me and was very accommodating of my tight schedule. She recommended tests that I would have never been able to get from a traditionally trained Western physician. Between her listening skills and the tests that she subsequently ordered, we had the necessary information that was needed to improve my health. She also follows up with me online to see how I am progressing and we have had consultations via Skype when necessary.</p><p>I am very pleased with the care and compassion that she has for her patients and I am grateful that I decided to see her. One appointment with her going over the test results, gave me more information than I had gotten in seeing regular doctors over the last 20 plus years. I wish I had known about naturopathic medicine and Dr. Allyn sooner!</p>'

       '<p>Naturopathic medicine is my choice for health care. After years of allopathic care (where the attitude was &ldquo;sorry, no answer, no cure, try this pill&rdquo;), Dr. Allyn quickly diagnosed that I had chronic Lyme disease. Now, I am free of its symptoms and only need to take a simple herb daily.</p><p>With Dr. Allyn’s thorough testing and analysis she empowered me with knowledge to control my food allergies. I can now make informed food decisions and identify the additives that are detrimental to my health.</p><p>Dr. Allyn also provides additional support through informational resources such as cookbooks, cooking and gardening tips and updates on new medical information.</p><p>I feel that I am now in charge of my health because I am supported by Dr. Allyn’s knowledge and dedication.</p><p>I am grateful to have Dr. Allyn Krieger-Fiedler in my life.</p>'
