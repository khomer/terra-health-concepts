					<h3>Why I became a naturopathic physician</h3>
					<p>As a young adult, I began to suffer from seasonal allergies.
						In spite of consultations with many doctors, trials of various
						prescription and over-the-counter drugs, my condition worsened
						with each passing year. In desperation, I sought out alternative
						therapies where I finally found modalities that truly worked in
						evoking healing and effecting a permanent improvement in the
						quality of my life. This experience convinced me that I should
						devote my energies towards helping and educating others to achieve
						the best health possible through alternative therapies.</p>
					<p>
						In order to accomplish this goal, I enrolled at Southwest College
						of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, Arizona, and graduated in 1997
						with a doctorate of Naturopathy. You can learn more about my Alma
						matter by logging onto <a class="topaz" href="http://www.scnm.edu/academics/doctor-of-naturopathic-medicine/program-of-study/" target="_blank">

					<h3>Emphasis is put on teaching patients self-reliant health care strategies.</h3>
					<p>If you are a person who has tried many different doctors and
						still have no resolution to your problem, then Naturopathic
						medicine may be able to help. As a Naturopathic doctor, I am
						trained in a different paradigm than the conventional medical
						doctor.</p>
					<p>My aim is to look for the cause of your ailment, not just
						prescribe palliative measures. Depending upon the situation, I
						will order tests that seem unrelated in the conventional model.
						For example, a patient with seasonal sinusitis (allergies/hay
						fever) may be shocked to learn that a stool test for GI pathogens
						is necessary. You may ask, "What do bugs in my gut have to do with
						getting allergy symptoms every spring?" As it turns out, a lot. If
						your immune system is busy "24/7" dealing with GI pathogens, then
						you have very little immune reserve to fend off the onslaught of
						pollen in the spring. Once the GI pathogens are identified and
						eliminated, then the immune system can perform better and you will
						have resolved your seasonal sinusitis.</p>
					<p>Food allergies can work in the same way. Many patients need
						to be tested for both GI pathogens and food allergies in order to
						permanently resolve seasonal sinusitis.</p>

				<br><h3>Naturopathic medicine is not for everyone.</h3>
					<p>If you are only willing to "take something" (a drug or herb)
						to resolve your ailment, then this type of medicine may not be for
						you. A Naturopathic patient must be willing to make the necessary
						life-style changes in order to obtain results. This means omitting
						habits that are contributing to your ill health. Dedication and a
						sincere desire to improve are paramount. Patience and diligence
						are important since results take time to achieve.</p>
					<p>As one of my patients, you can expect that I will use all my
						knowledge and experience to guide you on your journey to optimal
						health. You will have my full attention during office visits (no
						staff interruptions or phone calls). I am accessible by email and
						phone whenever a question comes to your mind. Frequent
						communication is necessary in order to achieve the desired
						results, especially when first starting a treatment protocol.</p>
